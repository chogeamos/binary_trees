Overview
Welcome to the Binary Tree Project! This project is a software implementation of a binary tree data structure. The purpose of this project is to provide a clear understanding of how binary trees work and how they can be implemented in code.

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. Binary trees are used in various computer science and software engineering applications, including search algorithms, data storage, and more.:
